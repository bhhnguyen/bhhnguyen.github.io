This was the second hunt I wrote with the Cardinality team, which ran in 2022. I was creative director and head puzzle editor for this event as well. This is probably the most ambitious project I've worked on -- there were about 35 puzzles and was much more difficult than the first event in terms of difficulty and scope. The story of this hunt revolved around a mysterious app that "breaks the internet" and reverts the entire web to a Web 1.0 aesthetic. Over 600 teams participated in this event.

As with our first project, I led the design of the overall hunt structure and had editorial oversight over every puzzle in the hunt. I highlighted some of the puzzles I was the primary author on below, and a comprehensive list of puzzles and links can be found at the bottom.

    This is from <a href="https://2022.huntinality.com/puzzles/chaos_in_neopia">Chaos in Neopia</a>, a puzzle where you are given a list
    of feeder answers and must match these answers to the appropriate "metapuzzle" they belong to. Pictured here are metas designed specifically
    for this puzzle that respectively involve a diagramless crossword, an Akari puzzle, and a cryptic set of Google Earth images.

    likes and how you can use the "Puzzlehunt Bingo" grid to progress in the puzzle.
