The first hunt I ever wrote for, <a href="https://2021.huntinality.com/">Huntinality</a>, was written with about 10 of my MIT Mystery Hunt teammates on Cardinality. I was the <b>creative director</b> and <b>lead puzzle editor</b> for this hunt, which consisted of around 20 puzzles. Nearly <b>500 teams</b> participated in this hunt, which was exciting for what was our first writing effort. I've highlighted a few puzzles from the hunt below.

As leader, I determined the hunt's story and structure. I also had editorial oversight over every puzzle.
