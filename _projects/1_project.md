The first hunt I ever wrote for, <a href="https://2021.huntinality.com/">Huntinality</a>, was one that I wrote with about 10 of my MIT Mystery Hunt teammates on Cardinality. I was the creative director and lead puzzle editor for this hunt, which consisted of around 20 puzzles. Nearly 500 teams participated in this hunt, which was exciting for what was our first writing effort. I've highlighted some of the puzzles I wrote below.

    These are screenshots from <a href="https://2021.huntinality.com/puzzle/wah_street_bets.html">Wah Street Bets</a>, which was the final and probably most memorable puzzle from our event. For our finale puzzle, I helped develop an incremental (Cookie Clicker-style) game built around accumulating coins. However, there were 8 mini-puzzles embedded in various mechanics within the game, including a series of cryptic clues that marqueed across the screen intermittently, a series of nonograms that gave the players various speed boosts, and a word puzzle embedded in the names of upgrades and achievements.

    These are screenshots from <a href="https://2021.huntinality.com/puzzle/thedatingsim.html">Dating Sim</a>, a puzzle embedded in a brief dating sim visual novel developed in RenPy. This puzzle was about determining how to satsify constraints about each of the dating show's contestants and making deductions about said constraints to get to an answer. (You might need to download the executables to play since the site is archived.)

    This is from <a href="https://2021.huntinality.com/puzzle/lolo.html">Lolo</a>, a puzzle consisting of four different minipuzzles. The twist here is that there are components of each minipuzzle that depends on one of the other three minipuzzles. Figuring out how each puzzle relates to the others is key to solving and extracting the final answer of this puzzle.

Though I had editorial oversight over every puzzle in the hunt, here is a comprehensive list of the puzzles I authored for this event. Each page has a solution that walks through how the puzzle works.

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://2021.huntinality.com/puzzle/lolo.html">Lolo</a>, a four-part puzzle where each part has a hidden dependency on other parts</li>
    <li><a href="https://2021.huntinality.com/puzzle/thedatingsim.html">Dating Sim</a>, a puzzle embedded in a dating sim visual novel</li>
    <li><a href="https://2021.huntinality.com/puzzle/wah_street_bets.html">Wall Street Bets</a>, a round of puzzles embedded in an incremental game we developed</li>
