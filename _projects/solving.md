<ul>
    <li>I won $10,000 from winning the <a href="https://contest.thepuzzlerbook.com/">Puzzler Hunt</a>, a multi-part puzzle extravaganza!</li>
    <li>I'm an escape room enthusiast who has done over 150 escape rooms all over the world. My favorite vendors (in the US) include the Palace Games rooms in San Francisco, Ghost Patrol in Emeryville, and Locurio in Seattle.</li>
    <li>I regularly do online puzzlehunts such as <a href="https://2022.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/archive">Galactic Puzzle Hunt</a>, <a href="https://2021.teammatehunt.com/">Teammate Hunt</a>, and <a href="https://www.pandamagazine.com/island/">Puzzle Boat</a>. Some of my proudest accomplishments online include winning the 2021 Teammate Hunt, the 2021 SILPH Hunt, and several Puzzle Boats.</li>
    <li>I also love live in-person hunts like MIT Mystery Hunt, Microsoft Puzzlehunt, DASH, and Palantir Puzzlehunt. I'm hoping to win MIT Mystery Hunt and take the helm on writing one someday!</li>
    <li>I've also served as a playtester and puzzle consultant on hunts like the <a href="https://puzzlehunt.club.cc.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon Puzzlehunt</a> and <a href ="https://ecph.site/index.html">ECPH</a>.</li>
