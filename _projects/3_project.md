I write puzzles professionally in collaboration with <a href="https://www.steinium.com/">Matthew Stein</a>, who started a
professional design company called Enigmada! Here are some highlights from the projects we've collaborated on.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/secret_sauce_title.png" title="secret sauce" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/secret_sauce_croutons.png" title="croutons puzzle" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    This is from a food-themed team-building event we run called <a href="https://www.steinium.com/teambuilding">Secret Sauce</a>. Solvers must solve puzzles in order to get physical items representing food that will allow them to plate recipes that they present to judges. There are 30 puzzles ranging from logic to wordplay to interactive written for this event on top of a fun creative component!

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
