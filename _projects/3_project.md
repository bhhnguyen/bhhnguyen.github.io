Since 2022, I've written puzzles professionally in collaboration with a friend of mine named <a href="https://www.steinium.com/">Matthew Stein</a>, who started a professional design company called Enigmada. Here are some snippets from the projects we've collaborated on! This list is ever-growing.

    This is from a food-themed team-building event we run called <a href="https://www.steinium.com/teambuilding">Secret Sauce</a>. Solvers must solve puzzles in order to get physical items representing food that will allow them to plate recipes that they present to judges. There are 30 puzzles ranging from logic to wordplay to interactive written for this event on top of a fun creative component!
