I write puzzles! Among other things. I intend for this page to document my puzzle-adjacent projects.

I've designed puzzle events professionally and for free online puzzlehunts. I typically write puzzles in the vein of the MIT Mystery Hunt tradition, which includes a wide variety of genres, including crosswords, cryptic crosswords, traditional pen-and-paper logic, and interactive games. I've created commissions for tech and finance companies, and I led writing on an annual puzzlehunt called Huntinality for the past two years. See my Projects page for more details.

Outside of puzzles, I used to work as a software engineer and data architect. My other hobbies include trivia, reading (mostly long fiction), and game development.
