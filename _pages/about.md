I'm Benji! I'm currently living in Hoboken, NJ, and I used to be a data architect and software developer by trade. Now, I work part-time creating puzzles while working on developing a puzzle-based video game.

Part of the reason I love puzzles so much is the endless creative possibilities. There are so many different kinds of challenges you can pose in a puzzle and many ways to present that kind of challenge. Because puzzles are designed to have hidden rules and hidden solve paths, you can never be truly prepared for every kind of puzzle, and I find that appealing. Additionally, part of the frustration with actually doing a job sometimes is that you can often never find a perfect solution to a given problem, and some of the problems you tackle aren't fun. Puzzles, on the other hands, have elegant solutions when written well, and they're challenges that are supposed to be fun.

Outside of puzzles, my other hobbies include doing competitive trivia, developing video games, and reading long fiction. My favorite books I've read recently include Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan novels and Roberto Bolano's 2666.
