I write puzzles! Among other things. I intend for this page to document my puzzle-adjacent projects.

I used to be a software engineer and later data architect by trade. Nowadays, I write puzzles both professionally and for fun I'm also developing a freeware puzzle visual novel game I'm hoping to release by the end of 2023. My other primary hobbies include trivia and reading (mostly long fiction).
