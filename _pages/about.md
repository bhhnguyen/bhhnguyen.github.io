I write puzzles! Among other things. I intend for this page to document my puzzle-adjacent projects.

I've designed puzzle events both professionally and freeware. I typically write puzzles in the vein of the MIT Mystery Hunt tradition, which includes a wide variety of genres, including crosswords, cryptic crosswords, traditional pen-and-paper logic, and interactive games. I've created commissions for tech and finance companies, and I led writing on an annual puzzlehunt called Huntinality for the past two years. See my Projects page for more details.

I used to be a software engineer and later data architect by trade. Nowadays, I write puzzles both professionally and for fun I'm also developing a freeware puzzle visual novel game I'm hoping to release by the end of 2023. My other primary hobbies include trivia and reading (mostly long fiction).
